# 2. Debugging Coding Challenge (30-40 Minutes)

### Step 1: Candidate Starts Debugging

**Interviewer:**  
Alright, for the first challenge, I’ll share a piece of Java code with you. This code is meant to parse and calculate values from a CSV file, but it’s not working as expected. Your goal is to debug and fix the issue. Here’s the problem statement and the buggy code. [Shares code via a collaborative editor.]

The program is throwing an exception when processing certain inputs.  
The goal is to fix the issue and ensure the output matches the expected result for all test cases.  



### Follow-Up Questions During Debugging
1. **On Understanding the Problem:**  
   - "What do you think is causing the exception? Can you describe the conditions that might trigger it?"
2. **On Debugging Approach:**  
   - "How do you plan to narrow down where the error occurs? What tools or techniques will you use to identify the problem?"
3. **On Assumptions:**  
   - "Are there any assumptions about the input data format that the current implementation might be violating?"
4. **On Testing Strategy:**  
   - "How will you test whether your fix resolves the issue for all possible inputs, including edge cases?"


### Candidate Explains Observations

**Candidate:**  
Got it. Let me start by reading through the code to understand its structure and functionality.  

[Candidate explains their thought process aloud while reviewing the code.]  

**Candidate:**  
It looks like the issue might be with how the file is being read. I see a potential problem here in the parsing logic—specifically in how null values are being handled. Let me add a few print statements to debug this further.  

[Candidate starts debugging and finds the root cause.]  

### Situations Where Candidate Needs Help
1. **Candidate Seems Overwhelmed by Code Complexity:**  
   - **Interviewer Prompt:**  
     - "What part of the code feels unclear to you? Let’s focus on one section at a time. For example, does the parsing logic match your understanding of the CSV structure?"

2. **Candidate Struggles to Identify the Problem:**  
   - **Interviewer Prompt:**  
     - "Have you tried adding breakpoints or print statements to confirm where the exception is being thrown?"
     - "What specific input triggers the issue? Can we isolate and test just that part of the input?"

3. **Candidate Misdiagnoses the Problem:**  
   - **Interviewer Prompt:**  
     - "That’s an interesting observation, but can we double-check the exact point where the exception occurs? What happens if we test the code with a controlled dataset?"


### Candidate Implements a Fix

**Candidate:**  
Ah, I see the problem now. The program isn’t accounting for empty lines in the CSV, which causes a `NumberFormatException`. I’ll add a check to skip those lines. [Implements fix and reruns the code.]  

**Interviewer:**  
Nice job identifying that issue. Can you also explain how your fix ensures scalability for larger datasets?  

### Follow-Up Questions After Fix
1. **On Scalability:**  
   - "How does your fix affect the program’s performance for larger datasets? Could this solution handle a million-line CSV file efficiently?"
2. **On Robustness:**  
   - "Does your fix handle other edge cases, like rows with only whitespace or unexpected characters?"
3. **On Future-Proofing:**  
   - "If the CSV format changes slightly in the future, would this fix still work? How would you make the code more adaptable?"

### Candidate Validates the Fix

**Candidate:**  
Sure. By adding the line skip, we avoid processing invalid data, which prevents exceptions and reduces unnecessary operations. If the dataset scales, we could further optimize by using a streaming approach to handle rows one at a time instead of loading the entire file into memory.  

**Interviewer:**  
Do you want to add any additional tests to confirm your fix?  

**Candidate:**  
Yes, I’ll add a test case for edge scenarios, such as entirely empty files or files with trailing blank lines, to ensure robustness.  


### Situations Where Candidate Needs Guidance
1. **Candidate Misses Edge Cases:**  
   - **Interviewer Prompt:**  
     - "What happens if the CSV contains a row with only commas and no actual data? Does your solution account for that?"
     - "How would your code behave with an empty file? Does it still run without issues?"
2. **Candidate Fixes the Symptom, Not the Root Cause:**  
   - **Interviewer Prompt:**  
     - "Your fix handles the exception well, but do you think there are underlying issues in the parsing logic that might cause other errors in the future?"

### Wrapping Up

**Interviewer:**  
Great. That wraps up this challenge. Let’s move on to the next one.  

### Reflective Follow-Up Questions
1. **On Learning from the Bug:**  
   - "What do you think was the main reason this bug occurred in the first place? How would you prevent similar issues in the future?"  
2. **On Code Quality:**  
   - "If you had more time, how would you refactor the current solution to make it cleaner or more maintainable?"
3. **On Testing Philosophy:**  
   - "How would you design a test suite to ensure that similar parsing issues are caught early in the development process?"

# 3. General Cognitive Ability - Coding Challenge (40-50 Minutes)

### Introduction

**Interviewer:**  
For this challenge, we’ll work on a problem involving data structures and algorithms. Here’s the problem statement:  

You’re given an unsorted array of integers. Write a Java method to find all unique triplets in the array that sum up to a target value. Return the triplets as a list of lists, and avoid duplicate triplets.  

Take a moment to think about your approach, and feel free to ask questions.  

### Understanding the Problem

**Candidate:**  
Thanks. Just to confirm, can the array contain duplicates, and do we need to account for those in the result?  

**Interviewer:**  
Yes, the array can contain duplicates, and the result should not include duplicate triplets.  

### Follow-Up Questions
1. **If the candidate appears uncertain but hasn’t asked for help:**  
   - "Does the problem seem clear, or is there anything you’d like me to clarify?"  

2. **If the candidate is silent for a while:**  
   - "What do you think the key challenge here is? Identifying that might help you decide where to start."  

### Candidate Outlines Their Approach

**Candidate:**  
Got it. My approach will involve:  
1. Sorting the array to make it easier to identify duplicates.  
2. Using a two-pointer technique within a loop to find triplets efficiently.  
3. Adding checks to skip over duplicate values.  

Let me start coding. [Begins implementation.]  

### Follow-Up Questions
1. **If the candidate doesn’t bring up efficiency:**  
   - "Do you think this approach scales well for larger arrays? Why or why not?"  

2. **If the candidate overlooks edge cases:**  
   - "What kind of input do you think might be tricky for this solution to handle?"  

### Candidate Implements the Solution

**Candidate:**  
Here’s my implementation. I’ve added logic to handle duplicates and used a two-pointer technique to keep the complexity to \(O(n^2)\).  

```java
public List<List<Integer>> findTriplets(int[] nums, int target) {
    Arrays.sort(nums);
    List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue; // Skip duplicates
        int left = i + 1, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
            if (sum == target) {
                result.add(Arrays.asList(nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]));
                left++;
                right--;
                while (left < right && nums[left] == nums[left - 1]) left++; // Skip duplicates
                while (left < right && nums[right] == nums[right + 1]) right--; // Skip duplicates
            } else if (sum < target) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
````
### Follow-Up Questions and Scenarios

### On Code Correctness
- "You’ve handled duplicates during iteration—do you think this fully prevents duplicate triplets in the final output? How might we test that?"

### On Testing Edge Cases
- "How would this handle an input with very large or very small integers? Is there anything about Java’s behavior with integers you’d want to double-check?"

### Candidate Testing the Solution

**Interviewer:**  
That looks good. Can you walk me through how you’d test this?  

**Candidate:**  
Sure. I’d write test cases for:  
- **Standard input with multiple triplets:** `nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4], target = 0`.  
- **Edge case with no valid triplets:** `nums = [1, 2, 3], target = 10`.  
- **Input with all duplicates:** `nums = [0, 0, 0, 0], target = 0`.  

### Follow-Up Questions
1. **If candidate skips a test case like an empty array:**  
   - "Do you think there’s a minimum input size required for this problem? How would your solution handle it if that condition isn’t met?"  

2. **On verifying correctness:**  
   - "How would you ensure your solution avoids duplicates for inputs like `nums = [-1, -1, 2, 0, 1]`?"  


### Candidate Completes the Solution

**Interviewer:**  
Great. What’s the space complexity of your solution?  

**Candidate:**  
The space complexity is \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of unique triplets in the result, because the input array is sorted in place and additional space is only used for the result list.  

### Follow-Up Questions
1. **If the candidate seems unsure about their answer:**  
   - "Does sorting the array require additional space in Java? Or is that handled in place by default?"  

2. **If the candidate answers confidently:**  
   - "Good. Are there scenarios where this space complexity might become a bottleneck? If so, how would you handle it?"
